# Course-Python-for-Data-Science

Exercises completed as part of Jose Portilla's [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

This course focuses on developing and applying the toolset required to perform data extraction and analysis in Python (via Jupyter notebooks). Through exercises which walk through several popular data science libraries and concepts, the course provides budding data science enthusiasts with an end-to-end framework that can be applied to personal and professional projects.

The first half of the course focuses on data importing, processing and visualization through libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas` and `seaborn`. The second half of the course showcases model development using `scikit-learn`, and touches on more advanced libraries for big data processing (`spark`) and machine learning (`tensorflow`).

Each exercise notebook walks through the particular library or concept in the context of a practical task / scenario, using provided datasets.
